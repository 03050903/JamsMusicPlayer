Jams Music Player
=================

Jams is a free, powerful and elegant music player for Android. Jams used to be a trial/paid app on the Play Store. Due to my lack of adequate free time and other issues, I've decided that I can no longer provide the level of support and active development that paid users tend to expect. Rather than letting Jams completely die off, I've open sourced the app and hosted it here to encourage other developers to potentially improve it and use it in their own personal projects.

I will still occasionally update this app based on my free time, but it will probably be beta quality code. If you are a developer who's interested in using Jams' current codebase, I encourage you to fork this repository and/or directly contribute to it. If you decide to launch your own fork of Jams on the Play Store, feel free to drop me a line so I can feature it on this GitHub page.
